The coverage often played for sympathy, ignoring anything about the subject other than his medical condition. In contrast, the bubble boy in this episode (voiced by Jon Hayman) is rude, selfish, and impossible to sympathize with. He is never seen fully on-screen, except for a pair of gloves that he uses to reach through the barrier; when he is shown exiting the house on a stretcher, he is partially covered by paramedics. The Bubble Boy also appears in the [[LINK|lang_en|The_Finale_(Seinfeld)|final episode of the series]]. He tells the court the story of what happened and George yells \"it was Moops!\""
