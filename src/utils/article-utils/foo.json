The race was run between 1924 and 1961 and over the years was held to a variety of vehicle class regulations and durations. In [[LINK|lang_en|1957_Formula_One_season|1957]] the Pescara Grand Prix formed a round of the [[LINK|lang_en|Formula_One|Formula One]] World Championship, a race which still holds the record as having the longest circuit length ever used for a Championship event."

The course layout featured an inland route through the [[LINK|lang_en|Abruzzo|Abruzzo]] hills, that passed through several villages, followed by a long, straight descent back to the coast, where a tight right-hand corner led on to a four-mile (6 km) long straight running next to the sea. The pit and paddock complex was located at the end of this straight. In an effort to slow competitor speeds past these pits the Pescara circuit became one of the first to have an artificial chicane installed, just before the pit lane. The Pescara circuit layout holds the record as the longest circuit to ever to host a Formula One World Championship event, with the [[LINK|lang_en|Nürburgring|Nürburgring]] Nordschleife coming second at about 23 km."

Perhaps fittingly it was Alfa Romeo, with their new [[LINK|lang_en|Alfa_Romeo_158|158 Alfetta]] car, that took the honours in this last competition before the outbreak of [[LINK|lang_en|World_War_II|World War II]]. In 1939 a \"Coppa Acerbo Song\" (with music by maestro Ignazio Civera and lyrics by Franzi) was published.

The change of format did not hinder Ferrari's chances of victory, however, and their cars and drivers took wins in both 1952 and 1953. Despite the success of the endurance format, though, when the Formula One engine capacity limit was raised to 2.5 litres from 1954 the Circuito di Pescara was quickly switched back to single-seat rules.
