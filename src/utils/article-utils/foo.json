The duration of stoppage time is at the sole discretion of the referee. The referee alone signals the end of the match. In matches where a fourth official is appointed, toward the end of the half the referee signals how many minutes of stoppage time he intends to add. The fourth official then informs the players and spectators by holding up a board showing this number. The signalled stoppage time may be further extended by the referee. [[CITE|39|http://fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws7_02.htm]] Added time was introduced because of an incident which happened in 1891 during a match between [[LINK|lang_en|Stoke_City_F.C.|Stoke]] and [[LINK|lang_en|Aston_Villa_F.C.|Aston Villa]]. Trailing 1–0 and with just two minutes remaining, Stoke were awarded a penalty.

[[CITE|17|http://www.usembassy.org.uk/rss/transcripts/worldcup2006a.html]] The same law also states that the duration of either half is extended until the penalty kick to be taken or retaken is completed, thus no game shall end with a penalty to be taken.
